    "## Summary\n",
    "#### Steps\n",
    "1. All the data and categories are copied to their respective arrays(test and training data are already split in corpus).\n",
    "2. A set of features are selected on the training data.\n",
    "    - Replace digits with character ' NN '\n",
    "    - Removed Punctuations\n",
    "    - Filtered Close class words from the documents using POS tag.\n",
    "3. Feature Vector is generated from the extracted features in the previous step using CountVectorizer\n",
    "4. Vectorize the category list using Multi Lable Binarizer\n",
    "5. Extrinsic Evaluation of multiple classifiers from Scikit-learn algorithm cheat-sheet and those taught in class.\n",
    "    - Selected the one with the best score.\n",
    "6. Training one classifier per class on training set.\n",
    "7. Predict tags from the trained clasifiers on Test set.\n",
    "8. Performance analysis on the test set.\n",
    "    - Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1-score for combined classifier and per class(tag).\n",
    "    - Plot confusion matrix for any class user enters.\n",
    "9. Pipeline - Predict tag for any data user enters\n",
    "    - Copy the data in the string inp_text\n",
    "10. Conclusion and Outlook into future work.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note  \n",
    "Cross validaton is skipped because\n",
    "- Only k-fold cross validation is supported in sklearn for multi value classification problems which split the training set randomly\n",
    "    - This can cause the problem of sampling errors that we are trying to avoid\n",
    "- The second approach \"stratified kfold\" which preserves the percentage of samples for each class, does not support multivalue problems."

    "    #Copper rebounded on Friday from a fresh 11-month low, as some investors regard the recent sharp losses as exaggerated and believe the metal has hit bottom. Copper, widely viewed as a bellwether for the global economy, has been battered by escalating trade tensions that resulted in the United States imposing tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports and Beijing quickly retaliating. The recent downtrend - which has seen copper shed 14 percent since touching a 4-1/2 year peak of $7,348 in early June - was fuelled by computer-driven speculators and long liquidation by Chinese hedge funds, said Gianclaudio Torlizzi, Partner at consultancy T-Commodity in Milan. Many people are wondering if the long-term bull market is over. I don't think it's over but copper has to hold above $6,200, which is the watershed level for the long-term uptrend, he said. It doesn't make any sense to have such a gloomy sentiment on metals demand. This is a good opportunity to go long again, Torlizzi added, saying he had already taken a long position\n",
